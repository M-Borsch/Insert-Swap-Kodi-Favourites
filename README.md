# plugin.program.orderfavourites
A simple Kodi addon that lets you reorder entries in your favourites, to organise them. It works best with the Estuary skin (the default Kodi 17.6 skin).  

Install it from [this zip here](https://github.com/doko-desuka/plugin.program.orderfavourites/raw/master/plugin.program.orderfavourites-1.0.1.zip) or from [my repository](https://github.com/dokoab/doko.repository/releases) to get automatic updates.

### How to use:
* Open the addon to view your favourites.
* Mark an item by selecting it.
* Select another item where you want to insert the previous one.
* Do this as much as you want to organise your favourites. When you're done, go to the bottom of the grid and select SAVE to commit your changes.
* If you want to start over, go to the bottom of the grid and select RESET instead, so your favourites file gets reloaded.
