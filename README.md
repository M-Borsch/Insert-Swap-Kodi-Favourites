### This is a simple & lightweight program add-on that lets you quickly reorganize your Kodi favourites.  
### Install it from these zips...  
### (Kodi Krypton 17.6 / Leia 18.9) [plugin.program.orderfavourites-1.2.1.zip](https://github.com/doko-desuka/doko.repository/raw/master/plugin.program.orderfavourites/plugin.program.orderfavourites-1.2.1.zip)

The main menu shows 3 options:

### 1) Order favourites...  
Opens a dialog where you can view and reorder your Favourites items.  
To reorder, select an item, then select another item where you want it to be placed.  
Press the Close button when you're done editing (your changes won't be saved yet).  
Press the "Restore..." button to restore the order from the favourites file so you can try reordering again.
   
### 2) Save and reload
Saves your changes and reloads your Kodi profile, so your changes can be seen immediately instead of you having to restart Kodi to see them.
   
### 3) Save and exit
Saves your changes but doesn't reload Kodi (as this operation can crash in some Kodi builds). After using this, you have to manually restart Kodi to see your changes.

### 4) Exit only
Just steps back from the add-on, no saving.

PS: I consider this add-on feature frozen, I just wanted a quicker way to move Favorite items around. Feel free to fork and modify it, the code is public domain.
