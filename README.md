# plugin.program.orderfavourites
This is a simple & lightweight program add-on that lets you quickly reorganize your Kodi favourites. 
When you run the add-on it will show all of your favorites on a dialog.
You select one item, and then select again where you want to put that item. Do this until you've reorganized all the items you want and then click the "Save & Close" button to commit your changes (you can also hit "Reset" to undo your changes and start over).

Install it from [this zip here](https://github.com/doko-desuka/doko.repository/raw/master/plugin.program.orderfavourites/plugin.program.orderfavourites-1.0.4.zip) or from [my repository](https://github.com/dokoab/doko.repository/releases) to get automatic updates.

(Those numbered thumbs are just so you can understand what's going on, the add-on uses your actual favorites posters.)
