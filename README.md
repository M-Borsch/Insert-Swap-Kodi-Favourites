# plugin.program.orderfavourites
Simple Kodi addon that lets you reorder entries in your favourites, to organise them.
* Open the addon to view your favourites.
* Mark an item by selecting it.
* Select another item where you want to insert the previous one.
* Do this as much as you want to organise your favourites. When you're done, go to the bottom of the grid and select SAVE to commit your changes.
* If you want to start over, go to the bottom of the grid and select RESET instead, so your favourites file gets reloaded.
