# Order Favourites (plugin.program.orderfavourites)
![icon](https://github.com/doko-desuka/plugin.program.orderfavourites/raw/master/icon.png)  
### This is a simple & lightweight program add-on that lets you quickly reorganize your Kodi favourites.  
### Install it from [this zip here](https://github.com/doko-desuka/doko.repository/raw/master/plugin.program.orderfavourites/plugin.program.orderfavourites-1.2.0.zip) or from [my repository](https://github.com/doko-desuka/doko.repository/releases).

----
The main menu shows 3 options:

### 1) Order favourites...  
Opens a dialog where you can view and reorder your Favourites items.  
To reorder, select an item, then select another item where you want it to be placed.  
Press the Close button when you're done editing (your changes won't be saved yet).  
Press the "Restore..." button to restore the order from the favourites file so you can try reordering again.
   
### 2) Save and exit
Saves your changes and reloads your Kodi profile (so your changes can be seen immediately, instead of you having to restart Kodi to see them).

### 3) Exit only
Just steps back from the add-on, no saving.
