The main menu shows 4 options.

### 1) Order favourites...   
Opens a dialog where you can view and reorder your Favourites items.   
- To reorder items, select an item "A" to "mark" it, then select another item "B" to either **"SWAP"** or **"Insert"**.  
(If an item is marked, you can select it again to unmark it.)  
- Press the Close button to close that dialog when you're done editing (your changes won't be saved yet).  
- If you've made some mistakes and want to start over, press the "Restore..." button to restore the favourites order from the Kodi favourites file. This will undo your unsaved changes.
   
### 2) Save and reload
Saves your changes and reloads your Kodi profile, so your changes can be seen immediately instead of you having to restart Kodi to see them.
   
### 3) Save and exit
Saves your changes but doesn't reload Kodi (as this operation can crash in some Kodi builds). After using this, you have to manually restart Kodi to see your changes.

### 4) Exit only
Just steps back from the add-on, no saving.
